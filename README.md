## Browse the hottest music on Reddit
Fresh beats is a project that aims to help users stay on top of musical content on Reddit.
###### Mechanics
It uses a Node and Express backend to fetch posts from multiple Subreddits using the Node Reddit API Wrapper (NRAW).
A front end built with Angular and Bootstrap then receives the list of links from the server and embeds a widget for each one using
Soundcloud's JS API wrapper. The last component is jQuery, which is used to remove any dead/invalid links.
